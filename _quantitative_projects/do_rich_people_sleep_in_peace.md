title: "Do Rich People Sleep in Peace?"
excerpt: "This study investigates the relationship between income and sleep quality using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2017-18). The analysis explores whether income independently affects sleep quality and how self-reported health status might mediate this association. Results indicate that income is significantly related to sleep quality. While higher-income groups are generally less likely to experience sleep problems compared to lower-income groups, adjusting for other factors reveals that even those in the highest income group can have increased odds of trouble sleeping. Health status was found to fully mediate the relationship between income and sleep quality for lower-income groups, suggesting that socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals may experience poorer sleep due to poorer health.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
Sleep is undoubtedly an inevitable part of our life. Despite an abundance of literature on sleep and its determinants and influencing factors, little has been explored on the independent association of sleep with income. The purpose of this study was twofold- i) to examine the relation of income with sleep quality and ii) the role of self-reported health status in explaining the socioeconomic differences in sleep.

<b>METHODS:</b>  
Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2017-18) was used for the study including several sociodemographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and self-reported health variables. Exploratory data analysis and Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to examine if the association between income and trouble sleeping was independent of other factors as well as whether health status mediates the socio-economic effects on sleep.

<b>RESULTS:</b>  
Income was significantly associated with sleep quality both independently and after adjusting for all other variables. In unadjusted models, relatively higher income groups were less likely to have trouble sleeping than the lowest income group. However, in the adjusted model, the odds of trouble sleeping were higher and significant for the highest income group (OR=1.14; P< 0.01). Additionally, health status fully mediated the effect of income discrepancies in sleep but only for lower-income groups.

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>  
Being socioeconomically disadvantaged might contribute to poor sleep quality, but higher income also does not protect against sleep problems. Lower-income groups are vulnerable to poor health status that can explain their sleep quality while further research is needed to address the sleep problems among the higher-income group.
